I’m an 18-year-old aspiring **Software Developer & Cybersecurity Enthusiast** from Zagreb, Croatia.  
Currently, I’m finishing high school at **Tehnička škola Ruđera Boškovića**, specializing as a **Computer Technician – Programming**, and preparing to start university.  

I’m passionate about **cybersecurity, software development, and red teaming**, and I enjoy creating projects that blend creativity with technical skills. I love exploring new technologies, tackling challenging problems, and continuously learning in the ever-evolving world of tech.
